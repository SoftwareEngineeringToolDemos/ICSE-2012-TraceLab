TraceLab provides an experimental environment for designing and executing software traceability experiments. 
 
-Getting Started 
 
1. Current UI Layout. 
 
Experiment Area - Located in upper right. This is the main working area for the experiment. Components can be dragged into this area to add them to the experiment. 
Components Library - Viewed on the left by selecting the Components Library tab located at bottom left. A collection of components can be found here. These components can be added to the experiment area by dragging and dropping. 
Workspace View - Viewed on the left by selecting the Workspace View tab located at bottom left. Stores data associated with the current experiment. 
Output View - Located at the bottom. Stores messages on current events in TraceLab. This includes messages from TraceLab and experiments. It is useful for keeping a log of events and displaying errors. 
 
2. Creating Experiments. 
 
Experiments are represented as a precedence dependency graph that shows the order the components are executed. 
 
3. Components. 
 
When creating a new experiment, a components package reference is needed. On the components tab, select the small 
brown icon at the top to select references. A collection of components will be available for use by dragging and 
dropping on the experiment area. Hovering the mouse over the components in the library will show the details. 
 
When you mouse over components in the experiment area, some additional icons will appear. Click on the 'i' icon to 
see additional information on the component. This includes parameters that need to be filled in for the component 
to function properly. The arrow icon is used to connect components by dragging and dropping the arrow. The direction 
of the arrow determines precedence in the graph. The trash can icon is used to remove the component. 
 
4. Running the Experiment. 
 
Run the experiment by clicking the green triangle at the top of the experiment area. The current component being 
executed during the experiment will turn green. Data elements throughout the experiment can be viewed in the 
workspace view by double-clicking the specific elements. A log of events will be displayed in the output view. If an 
error occurred, the corresponding component will turn red.
